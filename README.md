# README.md

I'm Mark, on the interwebs known as Joesepp, a self-taught, bored individual who likes to watch computers do things, who's equally both excited and confused. I thought that building software was like LEGOs :(

## What I'm Learning
- **Data Science -** we used to do this stuff on paper
- **AI/ML/DL -** computers do things, but intelligently!

## What I plan to learn (delusional dreams)
- **Blockchain -** a chain made of blocks??
- **Cybersecurity -** for when my chinese toaster becomes self-aware
- **Hardware -** I like raspberries

I don't use arch, btw.<br>
I strongly believe in vanilla HTML, JS, CSS supremacy. Who needs frameworks anyway?
